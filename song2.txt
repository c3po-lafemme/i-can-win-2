I don't know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me to the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down
I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret
I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay
